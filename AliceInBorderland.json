Arisu and his friends had no traumatic injuries that led them into a state between life and death. And the 7 hears girl who was with them, didnt have any trauma while having sex with her superior and entered the world while taking a shower.\n\nSo how is it a world between life and death?

                "body": "Well I think the ongoing sequel cleared up a lot of questions for me so I\u2019ll explain it from my understanding. None of the characters have actually experienced death or injury from the meteor yet they are playing the games to decide their fates. So if they lose an arm in the games but survive till the end it will be reflected in reality as a crushed arm injury or something. But if they die in the games they die for real. \n\nIn the sequel Arisu retains his memory from the new possible death a fallen piece of Debris from a building alongside six other people. But from how it was falling it could of killed everyone of them so I have to assume their fates haven\u2019t been decided yet.  \n\nGoing back to the original loud fireworks were blasting before the meteor strike so I assume that masked some of the sound of the upcoming strike and all they saw was a bright light before they were summoned to the new world.\n\nAlso the human mind is self preserving so I assume it would clear any new traumatic memory as to why many have trouble remembering what happened right before borderlands. But Arisu faced death many times in the original game so that may be why he is able to remember his soon to be death while other participants in the future game seem to have no idea.",

The 4 of hearts game was so cool! Why was that not in the show! I unfortunately can\u2019t read Japanese so I didn\u2019t fully understand the first game in the manga.

He hit him pretty hard and then tatta came up with this idea. He questioned arisu to follow him in silence so noone would notice. by that time niragi could have went somewhere into the maze, to hide himself. i remember that he was on the ground in a narrow like passageway, but when arisu hit him, after he tried to rape usagi, they were in the base? or at least a more open space. so i guess there was no time to search for niragi. still would have loved the autor to have included some explanation. for me this is a plot hole. :|",

But theres not much of it and most Ive seen has been created after the airing of the live-action.\n\nThe biggest place which brought AiB fans together was this amazing reddit page so I wanted to ask.\n\nWhy the manga been really not getting any attention until recently? Why didnt it get a full anime adaptation?",

Maybe the story doesn't resonate with a big group of people/people don't really identify themselves with it... Maybe it's the type of story that's more thrilling when animated/filmed, the characters are good but not really memorable... It has a philosophic touch that not many people can relate... Just a bunch of hypotheses.",
